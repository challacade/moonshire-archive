# MOONSHIRE Archive
Every release of the MOONSHIRE demo. The latest release can be played for free on Steam:
https://store.steampowered.com/app/2542170/MOONSHIRE/

NOTE: Recent save/settings data is not compatible with some older versions of the game, and it might crash. If this happens, you can delete or move your current save data, which is found here:

C:/Users/\<user>/AppData/Roaming/LOVE/\<gameName>

If the exe file is named 'moonshire', then the \<gameName> is also moonshire. Other versions may have this set instead to 'supergame', 'legend', etc.
